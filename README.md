# Overview of the City School District Analysis Project 

The objective of the City School District Analysis Project is to analyze student and school data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats. We prepared all standardized test data for analysis and reporting and presentation to provide insights on performance trends and patterns. These insightss will be used to inform discussions and strategic decisions at the school and district levels. 

As part of this project, we analyzed data on student funding and student standardized test scores. We analyzed all student's math and reading scores and various information about the schools that they attend. The objective is to aggregate the data and showcase school trends in school performance. This will assist school board and superintendent in making decisions about budget priority and budget allotment.

## Scope of Analysis

The analysis will include the following deliverables:

* A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
* An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
* Tables presenting each of the following metrics:
* Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
* The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
* The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
* School performance based on the budget per student
* School performance based on the school size 
* School performance based on the type of school

# Results

### District Summary

The overall % passing for the 15 schools analyzed is 64.9% for a total of 39,170 students across 15 schools in-scope for this analysis.

### Per School Summary

District type schools had the lowest % overall passing scores (

### Top Five Performing Schools

The top performing schools were charter type schools.

### Lowest Performing Schools

The lowest performing schools were district type schools.

### Spending Per Student

Schools with lower spending per student ranges performed better than schools with the highest spending ranges.

### Scores By School Size

Small to medium size schools performed better than large size schools.

### Scores By School Type

Charter schools out performed the district schools by 36.72%.

# Summary

Based on the analysis, we can draw two conclusions:
* The size and school type of the school have an impact on the school's performance. Smaller size and charter schools out performed the larger size and disctrict schools. An interesting observation is that small and medium size schools were close to par with medium size schools out performing small size schools by 1%.
* Spending per student does not have a positive correlation to the students' scores for math and reading and overall passing percentage.

## Recommendations

1) Re-allocate funding to smaller size schools so that spending per student is more evenly distributed across school sizes.
2) Conduct deeper analysis on the characteristics of charter and district type schools to understand the factors contributing to the students' performance and math and reading scores beyond spending per student and budget size.
3) Determine how funding could be better spent to focus on key gaps while continuing to invest in the factors that drive positive performance trends and patterns.
4) Students across the schools had higher reading scores over math scores. This is another area to investigate and potentially allocate more funding in this area.
