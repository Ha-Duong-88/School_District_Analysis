# Overview of the City School District Analysis Project 

The objective of the City School District Analysis Project is to analyze student and school data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats. We prepared all standardized test data for analysis and reporting and presentation to provide insights on performance trends and patterns. These insightss will be used to inform discussions and strategic decisions at the school and district levels. 

As part of this project, we analyzed data on student funding and student standardized test scores. We analyzed all student's math and reading scores and various information about the schools that they attend. The objective is to aggregate the data and showcase school trends in school performance. This will assist school board and superintendent in making decisions about budget priority and budget allotment.

## Scope of Analysis

The analysis will include the following deliverables:

* A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
* An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
* Tables presenting each of the following metrics:
* Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
* The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
* The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
* School performance based on the budget per student
* School performance based on the school size 
* School performance based on the type of school
